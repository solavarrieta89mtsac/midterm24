## Describe your project in detail below

This program will create webpages from a template by inquiring for user input.

The program expects an assets folder, with the page-head.txt, page-footer.txt, and styles.css files inside.

The following information is requested from the user for each file:
File Name
Character Name
Actor
Character Description
Character Image
Character Quote
Character YouTube Link

When the user inputs this information, a webpage for a WoW character will be created that gives a brief description of who the character is and who he was voiced by. It's a pretty neat program.
